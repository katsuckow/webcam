# webcam

packages:
openCV, adaptiveThreshold, pytesseract

This is a simple script that will open the webcam, remove shadows from, somehwat cleans the image, have a simple OCR run the image and print the detected text onto the image.

As of now, there is no confidence filter. The OCR constantly returns whatever text it can detect on the image from the webcam.

It shows the greediness of OCR systems in somewhat noisy environments.
